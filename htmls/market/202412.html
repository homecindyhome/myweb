  <h2>December 2024</h2>

  <p>
    The Greater Toronto Area (GTA) housing market experienced a transitionary year in 2024. Annual sales were up slightly compared to 2023, and new listings were up significantly year-over-year. Buyers benefited from substantial negotiating power on price, especially in the condominium apartment market. Average selling prices in 2024 dipped in comparison to 2023 as a result.
