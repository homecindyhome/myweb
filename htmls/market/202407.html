  <h2>July 2024</h2>

  <p>
    Greater Toronto Area (GTA) home sales in July 2024 were up compared to July 2023. While sales were up from last year, buyers continued to benefit from more choice in the GTA marketplace, with annual growth in new listings outstripping that of sales. The better-supplied market meant that buyers also benefitted from a slight relief in selling prices on average.
