    Greater Toronto Area (GTA) home sales increased year-overyear in September. Buyers were starting to take advantage of more affordable market conditions brought about by interest rate cuts and lower home prices.

    “As buyers take advantage of changes to mortgage lending guidelines and borrowing costs trend lower, home sales will steadily increase in relation to population growth. With every rate cut, a growing number of GTA households will afford a long-term investment in home ownership, including first-time buyers,” said Toronto Regional Real Estate Board (TRREB) President Jennifer Pearce.
