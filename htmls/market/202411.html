  <h2>November 2024</h2>

  <p>
    Greater Toronto Area (GTA) home sales increased strongly on a yearover-year basis in November 2024. Many buyers benefitted from more affordable market conditions brought about by lower borrowing costs. New listings were also up compared to November 2023, but by a much lesser annual rate. This meant that market conditions tightened, resulting in overall average price growth compared to last year.
