  <h2>August 2024</h2>

  <p>
    Greater Toronto Area (GTA) home sales were down on a yearover-year basis in August 2024. New listings were up slightly over the same period. While the region’s housing market remained well-supplied in August, average home prices only edged slightly lower compared to August 2023.

    “The Bank of Canada’s rate cut announced on September 4 will lead to a further improvement in affordability, especially for those using variable rate mortgages. First-time buyers are especially sensitive to changes in borrowing costs. As mortgage rates continue to trend lower this year and next, we should experience an uptick in first-time buying activity, including in the condo market,” said Toronto Regional Real Estate Board (TRREB) President Jennifer Pearce.
