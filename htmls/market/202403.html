  <h2>March 2024</h2>

  <p>March 2024 home sales reported through TRREB’s MLS® System were lower
    than the March 2023 result, due in part to the statutory holiday Good Friday falling in March this year versus April last
    year. Despite a better-supplied market compared to last year, there was enough competition between buyers to see a
    moderate increase in the average March home price compared to last year’s level.</p>
