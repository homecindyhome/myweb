  <h2>February 2024</h2>

  <p>Greater Toronto Area (GTA) home sales and new listings were up on an annual
    and monthly basis in February 2024. Selling prices also edged upward compared to a year earlier. Population growth and
    a resilient regional economy continued to support the overall demand for housing. Higher borrowing costs kept home
    sales below the February sales record reached in 2021.</p>
