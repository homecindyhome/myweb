  <h2>April 2024</h2>

  <p>April 2024 home sales were down in comparison to April 2023,
    when there was a temporary resurgence in market activity. New listings were up strongly year-over-year,
    which meant there was increased choice for home buyers and little movement in the average selling price
    compared to last year.</p>
