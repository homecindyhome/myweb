  <h2>May 2024</h2>

  <p>May home sales continued at low levels, especially in comparison to
    last springâ€™s short-lived pick-up in market activity. Home buyers are still waiting for relief on the mortgage rate
    front. Existing homeowners are anticipating an uptick in demand, as evidenced by a year-over-year increase in
    new listings. With more choice compared to a year ago, buyers benefitted from more negotiating room on
    prices.</p>
